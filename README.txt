== Description ==

If you have a very large number of tags, you may find the tag auto-complete feature slows you down more than it helps you. If this is the case, then this plugin is your solution.

== Installation == 

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Upload the tag-uncomplete.php file to your wp-content/plugins directory (not in a sub-folder).
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Tag Uncomplete.
4. Congratulations, you've just installed Tag Uncomplete.
